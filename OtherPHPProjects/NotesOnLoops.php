/**
while loops execute only as long as their conditional evaluates to TRUE.

do…while loops always execute at least once and then continue executing while their conditional is TRUE.

for loops contain 3 expressions and are frequently used to execute a code block a specific number of times.

The first expression is executed prior to the first iteration.

The second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration. If TRUE, the code block executes. Otherwise, the loop terminates.

The third expression is evaluated after each iteration.

foreach loops are used for iterating over the elements of an array. The key and value of each element is available in the code block.

break is used to end execution of a loop early.

continue is used to end execution of a loop iteration early and continues to the next iteration.
