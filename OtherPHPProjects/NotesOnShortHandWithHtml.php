/**
 * The PHP shorthand for loops uses a colon (:) instead of a bracket ({) to open the code block.
 *
 * The shorthand uses keywords to close the code block instead of a bracket (}):
 *
 * Use endfor to close a for loop
 * Use endforeach to close a foreach loop
 * Use endwhile to close a while loop
 * The closing keyword needs to be followed by a semicolon (;).
 * Make sure to re-enter PHP mode using <?php or the echo shorthand <?= before using PHP variables in the loop
